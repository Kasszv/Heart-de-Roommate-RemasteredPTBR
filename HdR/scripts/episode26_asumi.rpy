    voice as0921
    asumi "I always go with the flow, you know. That's why I decided without a second thought."
    "Everybody but Asumi had decided what to do after graduation."
    "I was worried when she hadn't decided her course in life."
    "But I didn't expect her to say this."
    "She just told me she made up her mind to study abroad."
    "I know she sometimes says unexpected things, but even I'm not sure what to answer her right now."

    asumi "Because I want to see the world with my own eyes and discover new things with my own feet. That means I'll be able to feel everything new out there using my entire senses, you know. I'm especially interested in Greenland."
    "I have no idea why she's interested in the country."
    "Yet I know she won't change her mind once it's settled."
    yusuke "I know you very well, Asumi. So I guess it's your final decision, but..."

    "After she nods, I start complaining."

    "I gently smile at her."
    "To be honest, it's very hard for me to be happy for her, so I just put on a fake smile."
    "That's because I don't want her to be worried or sad."
    "It's my wish from the bottom of my heart."

    "We burst out laughing at the same time, but I still feel terribly sad."
    "I have no doubt that I made the right decision."

    "That's the only thing I can do for her now."
    "If I don't control my emotions, she'll probably be at a loss."
    "Anyway, I'm sure she won't tell me when she plans on leaving."
    "Because we both know that saying goodbye is as painful as tearing our hearts apart."
    "That's why I make a promise to her."

    "Well, I can't blame myself."
    "Because her words were..."
    "It sounded like she just proposed to me."
    "A proposal from Asumi."
    yusuke "Asumi, you mean..."
    "I really want to know what she meant."
    "But I'm too ashamed to ask her."
    "Taking advantage, she asks me to promise her instead."

    "As I keep staring at her, I ponder."
    "It's so sad letting her go, but this isn't a permanent farewell for us."
    "Before we meet again,"

    "Little by little, I'll achieve my goal so that she can proud!"
