    "I remember so many things happened between us."
    "After graduation, I went back to Tokyo and spent a year trying to pass the college entrance examination."
    "On the other hand, Tomoe has been helping with her parents' business and going to the local university as well."
    "We're not together anymore, but we always tried to do our best."
    "Amidst the rush of things, we've been keeping in touch with letters and phone calls."
    "Sometimes, we even met."
    "But still, it wasn't like the old days."
    "As the day of my college entrance exam drew closer, I started concentrating on my studies more than ever."
    "It prohibited me from going to see her."
    "On the other hand, Tomoe quit school."
    "Because her hard work and anxiety made her ill."
    "She quickly got better, but she couldn't let her sister run their hotel by herself."
    "Little by little, we started having different lifestyles."
    "Then it made us forget something very important."
    "The feelings of love we had for each other."
    "Anyway, I became a college student in the spring."
    "The school was my second choice, but fortunately, I passed the entrance exam."
    "At last, I got some free time."
    "But for some reason, I didn't go to see her."
    "I can't remember why."
    "And when I got accepted into the university, she only sent me a letter saying congratulations."
    "I don't remember when I began to feel awkward writing letters and calling her."
    "And when did I start not missing her?"
    "And finally, I see her today."
    "Yet I feel dazed and confused."
    "I know she's right here, but somehow, I feel her heart is somewhere far away."
    "I guess our love has faded away."
