    "But with Marumu, I feel like playing with her more than being with her."
    "We only kissed once, kind of like children. Ah, I touched her breasts also."
    "But can we say we're a couple?"
    "Our relationship is almost as if we're pretending to be lovers."
    "Well, our relationship's much less than that..."
    "The more I think about it, the more confused I get."
